### Abstract:  
During the domestic coronavirus outbreak, as the quick evolution of the new mutation of viruses, how to effectively detect and analyze the evolution of coronavirus with high accuracy was a source of great concern. The Microcluster model, as a general topological data analyzing framework, was proposed in this project to detect and analyze SARS-COV-2 viruses’ evolution. Based on this model, topological features were effectively extracted and analyzed in evolving streams of SARS-COV-2 viruses’ genetic sequences. The results provided guidelines to analyze virus's evolutions and also showed high efficiency and wide usage for analyzing streams based on topological data analysis.
